`git init` is a command used to create a new, empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one in a given directory. When you run this command, it sets up a `.git` directory within the folder, which contains all the repository's metadata and version control information.

### How to Use `git init`:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Navigate to your project directory** using the `cd` command:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
3. **Run the `git init` command:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

### Result:
- The directory will now be initialized as a Git repository.
- You can start tracking files by adding them to the repository with `git add` and commit changes with `git commit`.
